## 📚 Learning Notes

### Key Decisions Made:
1. **Tailwind v3 over v4**: Required for shadcn/ui compatibility
2. **No src/ directory**: Using root-level app/ and lib/ for cleaner structure
3. **Slate theme**: Professional look suitable for developer tools
4. **New York style**: More polished shadcn component style

### Things to Remember:
- Use `@/` alias for imports from root
- Server components for data fetching when possible
- Client components need 'use client' directive
- Always use the appropriate Supabase client (server vs client)
